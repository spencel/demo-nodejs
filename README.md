A Node.js demo.

How to Install Node.js
=

1. Navigate to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the Long Term Support (LTS) version for your operating system. In my case, this would be Windows (x64), however, a Linux operating system would be preferable although not necessary.
3. Run the installer.
4. Use the default installation settings, which should add the node command to the Window's PATH variable.
5. Check if node is installed by running a CLI execute the following command:

```
node -v
```
The result should be something like this:
```
v10.16.0
```
